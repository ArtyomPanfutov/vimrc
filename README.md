### My configuration for vim

There are three main branches containing platform-specific vimrc and some additional stuff to make vim work with this vimrc:
  * [for UNIX-based operating systems](https://github.com/ArtyomPanfutov/vimrc/tree/unix)
  * [for windows](https://github.com/ArtyomPanfutov/vimrc/tree/windows)
  * [for InteliJ IDEA plugin - ideavim](https://github.com/ArtyomPanfutov/vimrc/tree/intellij-idea)
